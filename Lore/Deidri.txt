== Origins ==
Deidri is both the name of a village a few kilometers north of the capital Emal, and the citizens who reside inside it. In [https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/four-leaf/s2-episode-45-those-who-dont-dream/viewer?title_no=1454&amp;episode_no=46 Episode 45]they are also called "the ones who don't dream" due to the fact they cannot dream.

In [https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/four-leaf/s2-episode-60-answers/viewer?title_no=1454&amp;episode_no=61 Episode 60] of Four Leaf, [[Hugo]] tells [[Guadalupe Jara|Lupe]] that the Deidri are not native to the world they are currently in. They had traveled with someone named Mauli, across many worlds as soldiers.

In [https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/four-leaf/s2-episode-45-those-who-dont-dream/viewer?title_no=1454&amp;episode_no=46 Episode 45] it is revealed that [[Alvar Lambert|Alvar's]] father had made the hunter's clan, implying it happened after serving as soldiers for Mauli.

== Characteristics ==
The Deidri often share similar physical qualities with each other. Common similarities often include: Lack of dreaming, Sturdy thick hair, and big noses - which was revealed in [https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/four-leaf/s2-episode-45-those-who-dont-dream/viewer?title_no=1454&amp;episode_no=46 Episode 45].
