==Appearance of Bells==

The appearance of a bell is round and gold, almost like a cat's bell. They can vary in size, sound, and pattern, but cannot be modified by their holder, an individual bell will always have the same traits.

Every bell has a ribbon attached to it. The ribbon feels and acts like silk but is made of pure magic. The ribbon of the bell will take the color of its holder and it will be the same color as the manifestation of the holder's magic.

==Properties of Bells==
===Bell-less===
It is said that a bell contains the soul of a witch, this has not been confirmed but can be eluded to by the fact that when a witch's bell is stolen they lose all reason, ability to measure ones actions, and can no longer retain memories. In this state a witch's eyes turn black, and their magic will manifest in the same way (provided they have other bells) and will continue to be in this state until they retrieve their own bell.

===Power of Bells===
Bells are the source of power for all witches. However the number of bells a witch has is important. If a witch has one bell, it will have the same abilities and powers as another witch with one bell. Witches with single bells are unable to hide or position their bells as they please, leaving them vulnerable as a result.

The specifics of which abilities are accessible to a witch when having an amount of bells is unknown. To use abilities a witch must show a certain amount of bells to use a desired ability, but to empower abilities they need to only have the bells in possession. Example: if a witch wishes to lift an object, they would need to show 2 bells, but the lifting power would be very weak, where as a witch with only 2 bells showing but 4 in possession would have a much stronger lifting power. A witch with 6 bells is able to lift up a car.
