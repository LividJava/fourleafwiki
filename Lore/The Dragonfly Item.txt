The Dragonfly is a Sword created by [[The Lady]] via Wish from [[Liam Lambert]]. It's purpose is to be as strong as [[The Wolf]] but only in the hands of its true holder. Otherwise the sword is seemingly powerless. Whenever the sword is drawn, no matter the holder, depending on the intensity of the battle a storm will follow.
==Known Holders==
[[Liam Lambert]] - First Holder&lt;br /&gt;
[[Hugo]] - Second Holder&lt;br /&gt;
[[Alvar Lambert]] - Current Holder&lt;br /&gt;


'''Note: The amount of known holders between Hugo and Alvar is at the present unknown.'''
