==General==

Known for wearing red clothes and masks, they helped each other find gloom and collect bells to get stronger. They were considered a threat not only to humans, but also to other witches, as they viewed anyone who refused to join them as enemies. 

==Leaders==

There were two leaders of the Red Hoods.
Known as the "Long Haired Witches" by humans, and "The Roses" by other witches, the Blue and Pink Roses both possesed 6 bells each.
[https://fourleaf.fandom.com/wiki/Carolina Carolina] was confirmed to be the pink rose, while the identity of the blue rose is currently unknown.

==Disbandment==
When confronting [[The Wolf]], the Pink Rose betrayed the Blue Rose in a fight that almost destroyed Garúa town, and stole her bells. With 12 bells in her possesion, she tried to face the wolf on her own, but this one escaped.

The group separated afterwards, out of distrust for each other without the guidance of the roses.
===Festival of Roses===
A year after those events, Garúa town decided to celebrate the anniversary of the separation of the Red Hoods and disappearance of The Wolf by holding the Festival of Roses.
