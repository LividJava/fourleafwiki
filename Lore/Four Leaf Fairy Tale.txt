      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1287">Four Leaf is a fairy tale told in the universe. The story is told to [[Guadalupe Jara|Lupe]] by [[Alvar Lambert|Alvar]] in [https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/four-leaf/episode-20-bedtime-story/viewer?title_no=1454&amp;episode_no=20 Episode 20 - Bedtime Story].

== The Story ==
It tells a story of a hare who travels all over the world and finds a Lady, The Hare gifts her a four leaf clover and in return, [[The Lady]] says she will grant the hare any wish. The Hare asks for another creature, like him, that could travel the world by his side, but abandons The Lady without waiting for the wish to come true. Some time after, The Hare comes back with another four leaf clover and another wish. However The Hare finds a monster ([[The Wolf]]) instead of The Lady. The monster tells The Hare that as the new guardian of The Lady, he can't allow him to see her. The Hare says that it's okay, that The Lady is an old friend. The monster replies that he knows because he was the product of his wasted wish.

== Accuracy of the story ==
After Alvar's retelling, [[Cricket]] tells Lupe that the Wolf eats the hare, when she asks Alvar about how it ends. Then goes on to say that Alvar missed details of the story. There is no further retelling of the story after this episode.
