== Origin ==
According to [[Carolina|Lina]], witches appeared the moment humans discovered gloom, seemingly out of nowhere. So far, the people have spectated that their purpose for coming was to hunt down [[The Wolf]]. However, they're also obsessed with gloom, and will do anything and everything to feed off of it, even if it hurts others. Because of this, the wolf was heavily inconvenienced, and slowly, there was less sightings of the wolf, until it's been months since anyone's seen it.

== Appearance ==
Witches have an innocent or elegant appearance and use this pretense to make people lower their guard. They seem to range between the ages of 12 and 18 even though their actual age is not known. Despite their somewhat misleading looks they are very agile and resistant to damage.

Witches are sensitive to cold temperatures especially on their torso and arms, even during the summer. Theyâ€™re usually seen wearing long sleeved clothing due to their sensitivity but are fine with wearing skirts or shorts. This unique outfit became known as the Witches uniform. All Witches were assigned female at birth and any male Witches are transgender. As for their physical features they have pointed ears that can vary in length and extremely distinctive eyes.

=== A Witch's Eyes ===
All Witches have yellow irises that only appear when they feel a strong emotion of any sort. The stronger the emotion the more visible it becomes, as if the iris engulfs the pupil and makes it smaller. There is also a glow that emanates in their eyes that can be seen in the dark but not so much during daylight. Every Witch has a distinctive color that can be seen in their pupils. The color of their magic always matches their eyes and one of their ribbons that attaches to their bells. Their hair is also the same color but some Witches can choose to dye their hair or even use colored contact lenses to conceal it.

== Magic ==
Each Witch has a unique color tied to their magic. Humans studying magic can also have their own color but it doesn't show in any physical way. No two humans or Witches have the same color of magic although some look very similar. Tools such as staffs, wands, swords, etc. makes handling magic easier. Witches will often be seen using mundane items like brooms or traffic poles as their tools.
