All good wiki's have a sort of standard when it comes to pages, this helps to keep the wiki cohesive and readable.

The Four Leaf wiki has its own requirements for each page depending on *What* it is. For example, you won't expect an entry about a place to have details about a personality.

Each section on this page will contain a form of standards that can be agreed upon.

## Character Pages
For entries about characters, Major and Minor characters have different requirements.
