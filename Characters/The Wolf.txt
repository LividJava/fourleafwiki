== The Myth, The Legend, The Wolf ==
Not much is known about the Wolf aside from hearsay and fairy tales. It's a powerful creature that has horrified the citizen's of [[Carolina|Lina's]] world and is seen as evil. At the time that the story begins the Wolf has disappeared from the world. Some believe that the emergence of a Red Hood leader who obtained 12 [[bells]] scared off the Wolf without a fight. Despite its disappearance there are still traces of its existence that have been left behind in the world.

== Origin of Gloom ==
Upon the Wolf's appearance it brought along a substance (gloom) that was generated from its magic. This substance could be used as a source of energy that is non-polluting and seemingly limitless. Gloom is edible and is seen as a staple product of consumption for Witches.

== Fairy Tale Interpretation ==
According to the tale of [[Four Leaf (Fairy Tale)|Four Leaf]] the Wolf is a monster that is the manifestation of a wasted wish. However it's not clear if The Lady in the story created the Wolf herself.
