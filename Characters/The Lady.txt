{{Stub}}

== Initial Appearance ==
The Lady is usually referred just by second-hand accounts since her existence is questioned by the majority of the population because of her status as being just a character from the fairy tale, [[Four Leaf]].

The Lady has been mentioned throughout the initial episodes as the ultimate goal of [[Guadalupe Jara]] and [[Carolina]] to wish Lupe back home.

== Wishes Granted ==
* Liam Lambert, father of [[Alvar Lambert]], wished for a weapon that would allow him to face the witches, so The Lady gave him a stone that the hunters forged into [[The Dragonfly]].
* [[Carolina]] wished for a friend which ended up sending [[Guadalupe Jara]] to Carolina's world.
