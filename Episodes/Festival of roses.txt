== The Festival of Roses ==
The Festival of Roses was a celebration of the disbanding of the [[Red Hoods]] and the disappearance of [[The Wolf]].

The festival takes place a year after the Red Hoods disbanded and The Wolf disappeared.
== Festivities ==
In [https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/four-leaf/episode-17-time-flies-right/viewer?title_no=1454&amp;episode_no=17 Episode 17] [[Cricket]] exclaims "...and there will be masks, and flags, and red hoods. But not the real ones, the budget was a bit tight&lt;code&gt;"&lt;/code&gt;, implying that the 'red hoods' are people dressed up in costumes for the festival.

This is reaffirmed in [https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/four-leaf/episode-24-the-festival-of-roses/viewer?title_no=1454&amp;episode_no=24 Episode 24] where you can see that Red Hood masks and hoods are for sale.

Other festivities seem to include eating sweets, and wearing bells, as seen in  Episode 24. There are also balloons and streamers (with rose designs on them).
