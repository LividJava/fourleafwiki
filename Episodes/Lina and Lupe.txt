After a fight with her mother, we find out a secret Lupe's keeping about Lina.

== Plot ==
The episode starts with Lupe drawing up designs for her school's video game design contest during class. After the bell rings, we see Lupe and Lina having a small conversation about Lupe needing to go to bed early and not staying up working on the contest. 

Lupe then goes home to continue working on her designs and ideas, and while doing so, she forgets to do the dishes. When her mother arrives home, she tells Lupe she forgot to do the dishes, and then says she brought Chinese food for dinner. The mother asks Lupe what she was doing, as she did not do the dishes.

Lupe replies saying she was doing homework and working on a contest, when the mother asks what kind of contest, and it is revealed to her mother that it was a video game design contest, her mother tells Lupe that she will be going to see a psychologist. This causes conflict between the 2 characters, and ultimately ends with Lupe exclaiming that she will not see the psychologist, before storming into her room. It is then revealed that Lina was Lupe's Imaginary Friend.
