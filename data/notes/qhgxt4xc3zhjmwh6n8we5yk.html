<p>While this site doesn't have a built in editor like Media Wiki style sites such as fandom, it doesn't mean you can't edit the pages!</p>
<h1 id="editing-existing-pages">Editing Existing Pages<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#editing-existing-pages"></a></h1>
<p>At the bottom of every page you should see a link that says <em>Edit page on Github</em> Clicking on this will open the Github code editor allowing you to edit pages with ease!</p>
<p>Seen below is how a page might appear.
<img src="/assets/images/2022-12-09-09-55-11.png"></p>
<p>At the very top you can see the Front Matter. <strong>DO NOT EDIT THIS!</strong> You can start editing immediately below it! There is an exception, the <code>title:</code> field may be edited to modify how a title is displayed on the page.</p>
<p>After you finish editing, Scroll down to commit your changes. making sure to select "Create a <strong>new branch</strong> for this commit to start a pull request."</p>
<p>Make sure to give your changes a title, and a short description of what you changed.

<h1 id="creating-new-pages">Creating New Pages.<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#creating-new-pages"></a></h1>
<p>To create a new page, its not as simple as pressing "New Page" unfortunately.</p>
<p>First open the <a href="https://github.com/LividJava/fourleafwiki">Github Repository</a>, and navigate to the <strong>Notes</strong> folder.

<p>Then from here select <strong>Create New File</strong>

<p>And to categorize the notes. Dendron uses a delimited naming convention, where each successive period indicates a deeper hierarchy.</p>
<p>For Example. If we wanted to create a page for Lupe under the Characters category. we would name it the following:</p>
<p><code>characters.guadalupejara</code></p>
<p>Don't worry about Adding front matter like shown in the previous section! It will be added after someone with Dendron installed syncs their local repository with the Github repository.</p>
