This section was added to the end of Episode 12.
- Witches have an innocent, fragile and/r elegant appearance, which they use to their advantage to make people lower their guard.
- They appear to be between 12 and 18 years old.
- Though their age is unclear they grow up just like normal people.
- Despite how fragile they may seem, they're very agile and their bodies are very resistant to damage.
- Most witches have 1 to 3 bells.
_ They're very sensitive to cold weather on their torso and arms; that's why, even on summer time, they're found wearing cozy clothing on the top even though they wear shorts or skirts. This combination ended up being known as the "Witch Uniform".
- Their ears are pointy, length can vary.
- The iris is only visible when the witch is going through strong emotions; the stronger the emotion the smaller the pupil.
- All witches have pure yellow colored irises. The glow in their eyes is only noticeable in the dark and goes unnoticed at daylight.
- Each witch has a distinctive color (Excepting black*); This color manifests on their pupils and when their magic is visible (Rays, Shields, ETC.).
- All known witches were assigned female at birth; Male witches are transgender.
- Witches are fond of sweet food, which is a poor substitute for gloom. However a witch doesn't need to consume gloom to live\*.

### Witches' Notes 2
Source: [Witches' Notes #2 (External Link)](https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/four-leaf/witches-notes-2/viewer?title_no=1454&episode_no=31)

This episode was featured after the Season 1 Finale, and was broken into segments as it will be represented on this page.

#### About Magic
- The color of the magic of a witch is always the same color as their eyes and the one of their ribbons.
- The color of their hair is usually the same color as their magic, but not in all the cases.
- Some witches choose to dye their hair or use colored contact lenses.
- Each one of the 100 witches has a unique color to their magic.
- Humans who study magic also develop their own color, though it doesn't manifest on their physical appearance.
- It is said that there are no two humans or witches with the same color of magic, even thought some of them may look alike at first glance.
- The so called "tools" (such as staffs, wands, swords, ETC.) make the handling of magic easier; that's why its normal to find witches who have adopted mundane items as their tool (such as brooms, traffic poles, kitchen knives, ETC.)

#### Bell-less Witches
- It is said that bells contain souls of the witches.
- A witch without their own bell loses their ability to reason or measure their actions, and can't retain any memories.
- Besides that, their eyes turn completely black.
- A witch in this state will continue like this until they get their own bell back. Even though they'll be able to steal other bells and become stronger.
- In this case, the color of the ribbon attaching them to the bell will become black.
- It isn't clear if they can recognize their own bell in this state, or if they just look for bells indiscriminately hoping to find theirs.

#### About Bells
- Each one of the 100 witches used to have one bell in the beginning, but they started stealing them for power.
- Even though some may look similar each one of the 100 bells has a different pattern.
- Bells vary in size, besides having all different patterns and a different musical note each.
- A bell will always have the same size, the same pattern and the same sound, and these are unchangeable.
- Witches with only one bell cannot hide their bell, nor choose the position of it, which leaves them vulnerable.
- Witches with two or more bells can make them disappear to hide them, or choose where to show them.
- A witch gains abilities and power the more bells they get.
- Two witches with the same amount of bells will have the same abilities and power.
- A witch needs to show the bells necessary to use certain abilities; though they don't need to show more bells to make those abilities stronger. The more bells, the stronger the abilities can become. For example, A two-bell witch will only be able to levitate; while a four-bell witch will be able to fly at high speeds by only showing two bells.
- Once a bell is stolen, the ribbon attached to it will regenerate and slowly adopt the color of the new owner.
- A stolen bell will shine with the color of its new owner.
- Ribbons are similar to silk, though they are made of pure magic.
- As far as it's known, only witches can break the ribbons of other witches
- The bells are of witches are of no use to humans.

### Witches' Notes 3

There was a Q&A before this episode was published, it discusses the abilities gained with bells. While it will be represented below in a table. This was not done so in the original episode.

The number of bells a witch has in possession determines the abilities they can use. All witches with the same amount of bells will have access to the same abilities, Though some will learn how to use them sooner than others. Studies and practice can help greatly when it comes to learning a new acquired ability. Abilities become stronger and more versatile with every added bell; For example, increasing the cast range, or being able to affect several targets at once. The following list refers to the number of bells a witch needs to have in possession in order for them to be able to use that ability.

**Abilities gained with bells***

|Number of Bells|Abilities Gained|
|-|-|
|0 Bells|At zero bells a witch hardly has any kind of magical abilities and depends mostly on brute force. They can't be sensed by someone with the ability to feel presences.|
|1 Bell|Casting magical attacks, such as lighting or explosions. Though lighting attacks cause no more than a nuisance and explosions are similar to firecrackers.|
|2 Bells|Magical attacks become strong enough to cause burns. Ability to conceal items such as magic tools, backpacks or even their bells. Ability to perceive gloom in the nearby area. Magic shields against non magical attacks. Telekinesis. Levitation.|
|3 Bells|Magic Shields effective against Magical attacks.|
|4 Bells|Telepathy. Requires contact.|
|5 Bells|Flying at high speed. Requires a good understanding of the levitation ability.|
|6 Bells|The ability to teleport themselves a short distance|
|7 Bells|The ability to sense when magic is being used nearby|
|8 Bells|The ability to sense presences.|
|9 Bells|The ability to hide their own presence.|
|10 Bells|The ability to use all previously acquired abilities even when bells are concealed.|
|10+ Bells|???|

This is a non-exhaustive list, and in universe Witches with 3 bells have been seen with the ability to fly. This table will not be updated to reflect this in an effort to preserve it. and is merely a way to convey and consolidate all Witches' Notes on a single page.
