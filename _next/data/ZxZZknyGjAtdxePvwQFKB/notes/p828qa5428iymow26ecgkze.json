He has clear knowledge of The Dragonfly and later on Four Leaf. He seems to be quite friendly and personable.</p>\n<h1 id=\"personality\">Personality<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#personality\"></a></h1>\n<p>Cricket is a rather placid person, seeming to take things as they come. He seems to appreciate stories and takes the tellings of them quite seriously appearing to dislike when Alvar leaves out seemingly important details of Four Leaf . He also appears to be forgetful judging by his apartment in Episode 22 - A place to hide. Seeming to joke about a few things here and there in lightheartedness to ease tension as well.</p>\n<p><a class=\"color-tag\" style=\"--tag-color: #5f34e7;\" href=\"/notes/69lki2sb40pd79l2aaxc7tn\">#stub</a></p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/jx4dpa7wvrmme1hynp7iyon\">Characters</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/lzw2er4a53exd8ojdjlfu7e\">Alvar Lambert</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/4iof5rfj4t46eutdqzrax6k\">Carolina \"Lina\"</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/n7is5ixb8b9jaoo1njl5irg\">Emma</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"4eld83v9eo2oby5lp8a4e1y","title":"Four Leaf Wiki","desc":"A wiki dedicated to the Four Leaf webcomic!","updated":1671200193704,"created":1670590143926,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"flwiki"},"contentHash":"f1d20cb50077edd6206fcbae720ab2e4","links":[{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"4eld83v9eo2oby5lp8a4e1y","vaultName":"flwiki"},"value":"meta.github","alias":"Getting Started (Edit with Github)","position":{"start":{"line":13,"column":3,"offset":543},"end":{"line":13,"column":53,"offset":593},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"meta.github"}},{"type":"wiki","from":{"fname":"root","id":"4eld83v9eo2oby5lp8a4e1y","vaultName":"flwiki"},"value":"meta.dendronguide","alias":"Setting up Dendron for the wiki (In Progress)","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":3,"offset":596},"end":{"line":14,"column":70,"offset":663},"indent":[]},"xvault":false,"sameFile":false,"to":{"fname":"meta.dendronguide"}}],"anchors":{"welcome-to-the-four-leaf-wiki":{"type":"header","text":"Welcome to the Four Leaf Wiki","value":"welcome-to-the-four-leaf-wiki","line":7,"column":0,"depth":1},"links":{"type":"header","text":"Links","value":"links","line":14,"column":0,"depth":2}},"children":["jx4dpa7wvrmme1hynp7iyon","1xvb2a7f59scvmisqp0lnmd","87wos8z0r47jor2tx1qe2kf","mmjzgcn0or16dw3anl3efbu","v1lbmdo93v0sc7ojmli3hep"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"# Welcome to the Four Leaf Wiki\n\nThis is the third iteration of the Four Leaf Wiki...
